Conclusion
Based on the weather history analysis from 2006 to 2016, several significant trends and observations can be made. Firstly, there is a clear indication of rising average temperatures over the decade, highlighting the impact of global warming and climate change. Extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall, have become more frequent, suggesting an increase in climate variability.

Seasonal patterns have also shifted, with winters becoming milder and summers experiencing prolonged heat periods. This has implications for agriculture, water resources, and public health, necessitating adaptive measures to mitigate the adverse effects.

Overall, the data underscores the urgency of addressing climate change through sustainable practices and policies to ensure a resilient future.

The analysis of weather data from 2006 to 2016 aimed to test the hypothesis: "Has the apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicated an increase due to global warming?" The findings suggest that while average humidity remained relatively constant over the decade, apparent temperature exhibited fluctuations. Notably, there was an increase in average apparent temperature in 2009, followed by a decrease in 2010, a slight rise in 2011, a significant drop in 2015, and another increase in 2016. These variations imply that global warming may have contributed to temperature uncertainties over the analyzed period.
